# MagicaeMechanica

WIP

## Features
- Using aether/ether as an energy source for machines and weaponry
- Harnessing chaos and entropy
- Using souls and sculk for power generation, storage, and transfer
- Transferring souls of certain mobs into the bodies of other mobs (e.g. the soul of a tamed wolf in a warden body)
- Misc things that bridge the gap between magic and technology
- Some old things from MagicXpansion, my first ever addon that never saw the light of day
- TBD
